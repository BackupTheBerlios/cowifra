                    <tr><td colspan="2" id="nor">The configuration wizard framework was designed to set up
                    linux / unix applications in a step by step wizard. It is easy extensible with wizard files
                    which are based on the xml standard. Each application you like to setup with the cwf needs
                    the corresponding wizard file. If a correct file exists in the wizards subdirectory of the cwf, you
                    can choose this wizard from the main menue. For more informations about getting wizard files
                    for your applications, please reade the help information &quot;<a href="help.cgi?site=wizardfiles" class="nor10">Wizard files</a>&quot;.<br><br>

                    If you want to write own wizard files, please read the guidance.<br><br>
